# BobGame, a silly game created using Pygame
A Game I created in Python using Pygame in which Bob(A sprite I created myself using an online tool), 
has to dodge flying cubes of rainbow madness. This game was created using Pygame, in order to learn the
basics of pygame game development. Game keeps and displays track of score (cubes dodged) and speed of 
said cubes. Further changes may be committed.
